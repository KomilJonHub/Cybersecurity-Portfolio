# Lab02 — Vulnerability Assessment

## Scenario
I acted as the security analyst for an e-commerce company running a Linux server with a MySQL database. Most staff work remotely. The server handles business-critical data and is reachable over the public Internet. My job: assess access-control risk, rate the most likely threats, and recommend fast, high-impact fixes.

## Objective
- Define scope and timeframe  
- Describe the system and data at risk  
- Assess threats, likelihood, impact, and risk  
- Propose a remediation plan with clear priorities

## Artifacts
- [`Vulnerability assessment report.pdf`](./Vulnerability%20assessment%20report.pdf)

---

## Environment (as assessed)
- **OS:** Linux (current release)  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Network:** IPv4; public connectivity for business use  
- **Security baseline:** Encrypted connections (TLS preferred over legacy SSL)  
- **Usage pattern:** Remote employees connect to administer the service and work with data

## Scope and Period
- **Focus:** Access controls around the database server and adjacent services  
- **Standard:** NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 risk analysis  
- **Window:** Three months (June–August 20XX)

---

## Method
1. Collected system description, business process, and data sensitivity
2. Identified plausible **threat sources** and **threat events**
3. Rated **likelihood** and **severity** to derive **risk**
4. Wrote a remediation plan with technical and policy controls

## Risk Assessment (summary)

| Threat source        | Threat event                                 | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------:|---------:|----:|
| Competitor           | Data **exfiltration** to obtain sensitive info| 1          | 3        | 3   |
| Malicious software   | Disrupt mission-critical operations           | 2          | 3        | 6   |
| Standard user        | **Alter/Delete** critical information         | 2          | 3        | 6   |

> Interpretation: Operational disruption and excessive permissions drive the highest risk scores. Intentional or accidental misuse by a valid user can be as damaging as malware.

---

## Key Findings
- **Public exposure risks:** Service is Internet-reachable; baseline hardening and traffic controls must be explicit.  
- **Excessive access:** Users may have more privilege than required; changes to critical records are insufficiently constrained.  
- **Integrity and availability gaps:** Malware or misuse could stop operations or corrupt data.  
- **Crypto posture:** Use **TLS** for data in transit; retire any remaining SSL usage.

---

## Remediation Plan (prioritized)

### 1) Identity, AuthN, AuthZ
- Enforce **MFA** for all administrative and remote access.
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** with **least privilege**.
- Define account lifecycle and approval for privilege elevation.
- Turn on **auditing** for login, query, and admin actions.

### 2) Network Exposure
- **IP allow-list** for admin access (corporate egress and VPN only).
- Rate-limit and log inbound connections; alert on anomalies.

### 3) Data Protection
- Use **TLS** for all client-server connections; disable legacy SSL ciphers.
- Back up databases regularly; **test restores** and track RPO/RTO.

### 4) Malware and Disruption
- Patch OS/DB on schedule; enable EDR/AV where applicable.
- Monitor service health and query patterns for early abuse signals.

### 5) Governance
- Map controls to NIST 800-30 risk treatments; review quarterly.
- Tabletop scenarios for **exfiltration**, **DoS**, and **privilege misuse**.

## What I Delivered
- A concise risk model with business-oriented language  
- A control roadmap that can be implemented in sprints  
- Evidence in the attached PDF and a structure reusable on future systems

## Lessons Learned
- Risk concentrates around **permissions** and **exposure**. Tight RBAC and scoped network access remove most of it.  
- Backups matter only when restores are **verified**.  
- Encrypt everywhere, log everything important, and keep the plan short so the team actually executes it.
